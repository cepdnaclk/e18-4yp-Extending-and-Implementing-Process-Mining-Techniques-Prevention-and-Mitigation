## Abstract

Process mining has become a valuable tool for analyzing business processes. However, the quality of the data used, specifically event logs, significantly impacts the accuracy of the results. This project addresses the challenge of process-data quality by focusing on prevention and mitigation strategies. We leverage the Odigos framework to identify root causes of data quality issues within event logs. Additionally, we contribute to the PraeclarusPDQ framework by developing a software plug-in to analyze these root causes for specific event log imperfection patterns.

## Background

Process mining has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and improving business processes by extracting insights from event logs. These logs record process execution information, serving as the foundation for discovering process models, checking conformance, and enhancing operational efficiency. However, the quality of event logs significantly impacts the reliability of process mining results.

Recent research has identified various event log imperfection patterns that hinder effective process mining. Suriadi et al.'s work on "Event log imperfection patterns for process mining" categorized common data quality issues encountered in practice. These patterns include issues such as missing information, inconsistencies, and ambiguous data entries.
While solutions exist for some patterns, as demonstrated in "A contextual approach to detecting synonymous and polluted activity labels in process event logs," a standardized, comprehensive approach to addressing these issues has been lacking. The PraeclarusPDQ framework, currently under development, aims to capture and standardize various solutions for these imperfection patterns and other process-data quality issues.
The Odigos framework, proposed by Emamjome et al. in "Alohomora: Unlocking data quality causes through event log context" and further explored in "Root-cause analysis of process-data quality problems," provides a structured approach for identifying the root causes of process-data quality problems. This framework forms the theoretical foundation for the current research.

Recent research by [Suriadi Suriadi, Robert Andrews, Arthur H. M. ter Hofstede, and Moe Thandar Wynn. Event log imperfection patterns for process mining](SAtHW17) identified various event log imperfection patterns. While solutions exist for some patterns as demonstrated in [A contextual approach to detecting synonymous and polluted activity labels in process event logs](StHWS19), a standardized approach is lacking. The [PraeclarusPDQ framework](https://github.com/praeclaruspdq/PraeclarusPDQ/), currently under development, aims to capture various solutions for these imperfection patterns and other process-data quality issues.

## Methodology

This project falls under Project Type III: Process-Data Quality: Prevention and Mitigation. We will utilize the Odigos framework proposed by [Fahame Emamjome, Robert Andrews, Arthur H. M. ter Hofstede, and Hajo A. Reijers. "Alohomora: Unlocking data quality causes through event log context](EAtHR20) and further explored in [Root-cause analysis of process-data quality problems](AEtHR22). This framework provides a structured approach for identifying the root causes of process-data quality problems. We will develop a software plug-in for the PraeclarusPDQ framework specifically designed to analyze root causes of chosen event log imperfection patterns.

The methodology of this project falls under "Project Type III: Process-Data Quality: Prevention and Mitigation." It employs a multi-faceted approach:

This approach is distinctly proactive, offering both detection and prevention strategies for data quality issues, which is a departure from traditional reactive methods.
The research underscores the importance of addressing data quality at its source, potentially leading to more reliable and insightful process mining results. This, in turn, can enhance decision-making processes and improve overall operational efficiency in organizations.
Future research directions are outlined, including the refinement of root cause identification models, exploration of emerging patterns of data imperfection, and expansion of the framework's applicability across various industries. The project sets the stage for continued advancements in process mining and data quality management, promising significant impacts on how organizations understand and optimize their business processes.
